# Kite-Loop
An IOS weather app for kite surfing and surfing spots that let's you comment on the spot to give real time info

This a social weather app is build with SWIFT and uses google Firebase as a server. It uses Amazon S3 for image 
storage and alamofire for uploading and downloading. It's still a bit rough because I haven't finished the UI 
but all the functionality is currently in place.

Users can get local weather info for surf spots all around Ireland as well as see wave info from magic seaweed, 
see webcam footage if a webcam exists at the spot, view a map to the spot and also contribute and view socially 
contributed weather data in the social feed.
